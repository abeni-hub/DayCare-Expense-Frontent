# 🏫 DayCare Expense Management System – Frontend

A modern **frontend application** for managing **DayCare expenses**, built to work seamlessly with a dedicated backend API. This system helps DayCare administrators **record, track, and analyze expenses** in a structured, accurate, and user-friendly way.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **DayCare Expense Management Frontend** is designed to simplify financial tracking for DayCare centers. It allows users to:

* Record daily and monthly expenses
* Manage expense items (quantity, unit price, totals)
* Categorize expenses (e.g., Stationery, Food, Utilities)
* Track VAT-enabled and non-VAT expenses
* View paginated expense history
* Integrate securely with a backend API

This frontend consumes a **RESTful backend service** and focuses on **performance, scalability, and clean UI/UX**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **React + TypeScript** – Component-based UI with strong typing
* **Redux Toolkit** – Global state management
* **RTK Query** – Data fetching, caching, and API state management
* **Vite** – Fast development and build tooling
* **Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules** – Responsive UI styling

### Backend Integration

* REST API (JSON-based)
* Token-based authentication (if enabled)
* Pagination support (`count`, `next`, `previous`)

---

## 🔗 Backend Integration Architecture

The frontend communicates with the backend using **RTK Query**, which provides:

* Automatic caching
* Request deduplication
* Loading & error state handling
* Strong TypeScript integration

### Example API Response Structure

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "items": [],
      "date": "2026-01-17",
      "category": "Stationery",
      "total_expense": "150.00"
    }
  ]
}
```
